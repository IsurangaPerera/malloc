Malloc
======

Malloc / Free / Realloc / Calloc implementation using a red-black tree.
They change the program's data segment size according to the memory page size.

Define BEST_FIT during compilation to use best-fit algorithm instead of first-fit (file malloc.c).

Can be used with any programs but the ones using their own memory allocator.
With some systems and some programs, glibc is used, you have to define in the environment G_SLICE=always-malloc.

Example
