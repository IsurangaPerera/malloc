# malloc

Malloc implementation using a red-black tree

Define BEST_FIT during compilation to use best-fit algorithm instead of first-fit (file malloc.c)

Can be used with any programs but the ones using their own memory allocator
With some systems, glibc is used, then you have to define in the environment G_SLICE=always-malloc
